# IntermediatePython
_Estimated 2 months to complete_
Python is a general-purpose coding language with applications in web development, 
**data science**, **machine learning**, **fintech** and more. 
The [Intermediate Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intermediate-python-nanodegree--nd303)
program equips students to leverage the capabilities of Python and streamline 
the functionality of applications that perform complex tasks, such as **classifying files**, **data mining** a **webpage**, etc.
By the end of the program, we create a portfolio that demonstrates our ability to apply practicioner-level Python skills on the job.
In this repository, I use Python to develop two projects: 
1. search for and explore close approaches of near-Earth objects (NEOs), using data from NASA/JPL's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. 
2. build a "meme generator" â€“ a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. I also include examples.
