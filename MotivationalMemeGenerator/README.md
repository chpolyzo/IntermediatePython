# This is a project for the Intermediate Python Nanodegree

Python is well suited for solving both web and data problems. 
In this project we build a service that demonstrates an understanding of both of these domains.
First, we import quote data from many different data types (PDF, DOCX, CSV, TXT). 
Then, we demonstrate an understanding of the Strategy Object design pattern to write clean,
modular code to handle these different file types. 
Then, we resize images and overlay the quotes onto the resized graphics.
Finally, we practice making our service available for others to use as a command line utility and as a deployable web service.
